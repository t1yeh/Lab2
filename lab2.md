## Part 3
On top of getting a refresher on last weeks search engine as well as bash commands such as cd and pwd, I learnt that -a is a way for me to show hidden files on the @ieng6 virtual directories, and how echo and scp can be used to write text/ or files into certain files or direcctories -- all of which are useful commands to know when accessing public and private keys. Additionally, I also learnt know how public nad private keys work together to authenticate a user into a virtual mamchine.
